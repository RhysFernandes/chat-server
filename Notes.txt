Setup server to run: "make server"

Run: "./server {port}"

Clean: "make clean"


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently done: 
- Port configurable when server.exe file runs
- Server is setup.
- Multiple clients can connect, disconnect, and send messages.
- Clients are informed of users joining and leaving.
- If problems with client messages, the server send ERRORs with some information. The server also outputs same client error which should be considered as logging.



To do: 

- Remove room from rooms
- Proper error checking.
- More testing.
- Locks are needed for threading.
- Set boundary limits for users to what the system can handle.
- More error results to client would be nice.

-Nice to have:
	- Create testfile to test functions/methods.

Things to consider:
	Clients with the same username? Probably should not be allowed.

Testing:

- Scenario: 2 Users Join, send some messages and 1 leaves
	- Connect: telnet localhost 1234
	- User1: JOIN lordoftherings Bilbobaggins
	- User2: JOIN lordoftherings Hobbit
	- Messages occur
	- User1 or User2 disconnects: 'Ctrl ]' + quit (in this order to exit telnet).
